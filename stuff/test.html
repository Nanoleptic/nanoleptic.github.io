<h3>Archive</h3>

<p><video src="https://i.imgur.com/07C7Jtf.mp4" alt="Archive" title="" autoplay loop/></p>

<p>Archive was an experimental short story about a person sentenced to death for knowing too much. As they grip to their speeder, hackers tapped into their brain, trying to retrieve that fateful memory before the inevitable firey crash. <br />
This project was never finished.</p>

<h3>Her Garden</h3>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4H041Qf.gif" alt="Her Garden" title="" /></p>

<p>Her Garden was a procedurally generated gardening/exploration game. When a player launched the game for the first time, they were given a garden with a unique colour palette and mysterious plants. The plants slowly grew, dropping seeds and turning the garden into a forest. <br />
The player could collect seeds to plant them in other places, cut down unruly plants and move around the rocks and torches as they tended to their garden. <br />
If the player crossed the threshold, they would be transported to another player's garden. They could walk around and take in the beauty of a strangers little corner of heaven, collect a few seeds, and plant some new flowers back at home. <br />
The gardens were taken offline when no more gardeners visited</p>

<h3>Plume</h3>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E1eSizf.gif" alt="Plume" title="" /></p>

<p>Plume is a short game made during a train trip, about a calligrapher who sold their soul to a cursed vial of ink. <br />
This project was further developed for <a href="http://www.naturalpad.fr/">NaturalPad</a>, who expressed interest in using the game for wrist injury rehabilitation. <br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfqyjK4H1tU">Here's what I made for them</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D49mthWZ6oE">here's what they've been doing with it</a></p>

<h3>Super Mega Death-o-Tron</h3>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LmjFdkw.gif" alt="Super Mega Death-o-Tron" title="" /></p>

<p>I was beatboxing, and to transition to a new beat, I said "Super Mega Death-o-Tron" and then did my best to make dubstep noises with my mouth. <br />
The name "Super Mega Death-o-Tron" was funny enough for me to try and make a small prototype of how such a machine would behave. <br />
It really needs bullet casings! <br />
I can't remember why I didn't go any further with this...   </p>

<h3>HopPopPop</h3>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YGrxpo4.gif" alt="HopPopPop" title="" /></p>

<p>This game has bullet casings! <br />
Unfortunately, I hadn't yet uploaded it to a off-site repo when my laptop was stolen in a burglary. This game is no more...</p>

<h3>Blast 10</h3>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yFroNam.gif" alt="Blast 10" title="" /></p>

<p>A super arcadey shmup thing, originally made to show some "juicy" techniques, I just never really stopped working on it. <br />
It's going to be released soon, and has some really cool music made by <a href="https://cyanidedansen.bandcamp.com/album/corona-zeatin">Cyanide Dansen</a></p></div>
