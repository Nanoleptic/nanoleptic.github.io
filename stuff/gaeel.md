I'm a game programmer and designer, a "multimedia" "artist", I like to make things that move, and I'm bad at writing words.   
I can usually be found mucking about with computery things, either programming or building custom computer keyboards.   
Otherwise, I like to hang out with my housemates, in close proximity to some decent beer and hot chips.

Here's how to get in touch:
